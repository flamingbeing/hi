// Kaki Home: help for first-time users. Two parts, kept here so app.js stays small:
// 1. The welcome: a short, skippable sheet, shown once per phone. New users get two cards (what it's for, then "fill
//    it in a minute", which opens the quick start in tour.js); the home screen and sharing are steps in the Home
//    checklist instead (tour.js). Shown once per phone (localStorage 'kakihome:welcomed'). Never in ?demo unless ?welcome is added;
//    never for someone who already uses the app (items, a household or a name on this phone). Someone opening an
//    invite (the link ends #/settings) gets a shorter version that ends at Sign in. Skip, back, Escape or dragging
//    the sheet down all close it, and it never comes back on its own ("Show the welcome again" in Settings).
// 2. The guide screen (#/guide, "How to use Kaki Home"): short grouped sections, linked from Settings and from the
//    empty Home screen.
// Everything is kit components (/homedesign/); the few own styles are kh-w* and kh-dots in kakihome.css.
